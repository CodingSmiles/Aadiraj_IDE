# Aadiraj "IDE"

I named it an "IDE" because it sounded good, not because it's an IDE. This entire thing is basically a joke and it's really bad. Sorry. You can download it for Windows from the "setup" folder. There is an InnoScript file that can be used to compile it (it as in the installer) from a local fork.
